# SQL Injection Learning Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to learning about SQL injection and understanding how it works. The goal is to provide detailed explanations and examples to help you grasp the concepts behind SQL injection attacks.

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL injection is a type of web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into an application's database query. This occurs when user-supplied input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in SQL statements.

## Types of SQL Injection Attacks

Explore various types of SQL injection attacks, such as:

- Union-based SQL injection
- Blind SQL injection
- Error-based SQL injection
- Time-based SQL injection

## Detecting and Preventing SQL Injection

Learn about best practices and techniques for detecting and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities in your applications. This section will cover topics like:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Prepared statements and parameterized queries
- Web application firewalls
- Database security measures

## Examples of SQL Injection

This section will provide practical examples of SQL injection attacks. We'll present vulnerable code snippets and demonstrate how an attacker can exploit them. It's important to note that these examples should only be used for educational purposes and must not be deployed in a production environment.
